# Timescale Frontend Task

# Improvements to be made

If this was a real project I would use the following:

- react-router to enable page navigation and componenization of further elements
- react-query to reduce useEffect code, handle caching and help with pagination
- react-modal to provide popups
- Ensuring we're only requesting the data we need
- Optimise images
- Use of CSSGrid to display list of movies

# Issues

- API is inconsistent in naming convention.
- API has bad data such as movies without a cover, rating, description or title.
